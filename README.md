# Onchain-Puzzle
Onchain Puzzle is a fully onchain puzzle game built with Solidity. Players must solve tile-based puzzles by rearranging pieces into the correct order. All game logic and state are stored directly on the blockchain. This project is ideal for learning how to build interactive games using smart contracts.
